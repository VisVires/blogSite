  <p>Today will be about refactoring some old code and start moving some old projects forward. I'd like to refactor my code for my RESTful API, my Android Project and the Unity 3D Game. I'd also like to start building the web interface for the PinchTest application so my clients have an interface they can use to monitor their results. I'll be working on these for the rest of the week. I'd also like to make a blog post about Networking Protocols. Finally I'm going to make modal windows for weekly activites to unclutter my site a bit.</p>

  <p>Created a script to append new photos to the JSON file used for photos yesterday, so today I'm going to work on routing for the individual blog posts for both the fitness and tech blogs. Today is busy with interviews and such so we'll see how much I can get done.</p>

  <p>The plan today is to add download links for my resume page and adjust the python script to add pictures to JSON array for photographs with options to add a caption and location for each image. Run all photos through new script with extra fields for more complete information. Considering creating batch watermarking program to watermark each photo.</p>

  <p>As I'm getting closer to having this site ready, I'm cleaning up loose ends and preparing content, today's focus will be on a fitness blog post as well as adding some media to the site in the form of either embedded youtube workouts or a link to a youtube account from the fitness page. I'd also like to move each of the daily posts to thumbnails or some other item to make the page cleaner.</p>

  <p>Today's focus was getting everything secure. Using an AWS EC2 instance and Route53 can be overkill for a simple blog site like this one and so I was looking at ways to keep pricing down but still have a secure page. AWS has a free SSL Certificate Manager if you use CloudFront or an Elastic Load Balancer for your site, but neither are necessary for this site, and each comes with extra fees for the services. My solution was to set up Cloudflare as a proxy then create a security group via AWS to only allow incoming requests from Cloudflare. This way there is no compromise in security from Cloudflare to the EC2 instance.</p>

<h2 class="blog-post-title">What happens when you input ls -l foo* in your bash shell?</h2>
  <p class="blog-post-meta">November 17, 2017</p>
  <p>This was an interview question I saw recently for a System Administrator role, and while there are many resources to answer this question, I didn't feel any were complete enough. My hope is to start with a high level overview and gradually make this post get deeper and deeper into the rabbit hole of the ls command.</p>
  <hr>
  <h3>The Parent Shell</h3>
    <div class="well-sm">
      <code>$ls -l foo*</code>
    </div>
    <p>User writes command into stdin of shell which is waiting with getline() function</p>
    <p>Then the bash shell checks if command is an alias and if not it checks if command exists via a script similar to the following, where it uses the bash builtin command "command" to see if the command exists in PATH</p>
    <div class="well-sm">
      <code>
      #!/bin/sh<br>
      #$1 holds the requested command<br>
      if command -v $1  &>/dev/null<br>
      then<br>
      <code class="indent">return 1</code><br>
      else<br>
      <code class="indent">return 0</code><br>
      fi
      </code>
    </div>
    <p>The <code>command</code> command works by using the <code>stat()</code> C function which returns information about a file if it can find it or -1 and an error if not. </p>
    <p> The PATH is then tokenized using the ":" to separate each element and each segment in the path is checked to search for the command.</p><br>
    <p>Here's an example of the search from my own PATH:</p>
    <div class="well-sm">
      <code>stat("/home/username/bin/ls", 0x7ffc92ee7d20) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)<br>
      stat("/home/username/.local/bin/ls", 0x7ffc92ee7d20) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)<br>
      stat("/usr/local/sbin/ls", 0x7ffc92ee7d20) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)<br>
      stat("/usr/local/bin/ls", 0x7ffc92ee7d20) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)<br>
      stat("/usr/sbin/ls", 0x7ffc92ee7d20) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)<br>
      stat("/usr/bin/ls", 0x7ffc92ee7d20) = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)<br>
      stat("/sbin/ls", 0x7ffc92ee7d20)    = -1 ENOENT (No such file or directory)<br>
      stat("/bin/ls", 0x7ffc92ee7d20)     = 0<br>
      </code>
    </div>
    <p> As you can see the command is found in the /bin folder.
    <p>If the command is valid the shell then uses the fork() system call to start allocating resources to handle the new command</p>
    <h3>The fork() System Call</h3>
    <p>When the fork() system call is executed a series of events happen to create a new process:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>fork() system call and switches control from user mode to kernel mode by issuing a trap passing control to the interrupt vector 0x80, when int 0x80 is executed the call transfers to the kernel entry point _system_call. This is the same for all system calls and saves all the registers.</li>
      <li>The next instruction is the assembly instruction <code>pushl eax</code> which pushes a long onto the eax register that represents the actual system call.</li>
      <li>Any arguments are sent to the other registers</li>
      <li>The kernel executes the system call then returns the result to the user program</li>
      <li>With the fork() execution by the kernel an <em>almost</em> exact copy of the parent process is made called the child process with the following events:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Child's task structure is allocated</li>
        <li>Child's task structure is filled from the parent</li>
        <li>Child's stack and user area's are allocated</li>
        <li>Child's user area filled from parent</li>
        <li>A Process ID (PID) is allocated for the child</li>
        <li>Child is set up to share parent's text</li>
        <li>Page tables for data and stack are copied</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Note: Many modern Linux systems give the child page tables but instead of copying them it just has them point to the parent's pages. If the child or parent attemptes to write on the page then a new copy of the page is allocated..this will save memory and is called a <strong>copy on write.</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Sharing of open files between child and parent is set up</li>
        <li>Parents registers are copied from parent to child</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
    <p>This series of steps creates a new shell almost identical to the parent except for:</p> 
    <ul>
      <li>PID</li>
      <li>Parent's PID</li>
      <li>It has it's own copy of file descriptors and directory streams</li>
      <li>Process, text, data and memory locks</li>
      <li>Process times in the tms struct</li>
      <li>Resource utilizations for new process set at 0</li>
      <li>Pending signals initialize to the empty set</li>
      <li>Timers created not inherited</li>
      <li>Asynchronous input or output operations are not inherited</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Processing the Command</h3>
    <p>Once the new child process is created we need to execute the command. which will be done with the <code>execve()</code></p>
    <p>The exec commands purpose is to replace the current program with the specified program. In bash there are a couple types of exec commands:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>int execl(char *path, char *arg1, ... char* argn)</code><br>(uses strings as arguments from 1 to n)</li>
      <li><code>int execv(char *path, char *arg[])</code><br>(uses an array of pointers to strings as arguments)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The specific command in this case is:</p>
    <div class="well-sm">
    <code>execve("/bin/ls", ["ls", "-l", "foo.cpp", "foobar", "fooie"], [/* 68 vars */])</code>
    </div>
    <p> As you can see the first argument is the path, the second is an array of strings as arguments including the command "ls","-l", "foo.cpp", "foobar",and "fooie", the final argument is the enviroment variables.</p>
    <p>As you can see an expansion has occured. The original foo* argument was expanded with the current files in the directory that start with the specified parameter "foo", we'll get into how this happened in a later post.</p>   
    <!--<p>Now we need to back up for a minute as the thing we input was foo* and yet that argument has been expanded to foo.cpp, foobar and fooie, how did that happen?</p>-->
    <p>When the <code>execv()</code> is called on the valid command several steps occur to replace the current shell with ls.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>First we find the executable program</li>
      <li>Verify the executable permissions for the program</li>
      <li>The shell reads the header then verifies it</li>
      <li>The arguments and enviromental strings are copied to the kernel</li>
      <li>The old address space is freed</li>
      <li>A new address space is allocated</li>
      <li>Arguments and enviromental variables are copied to stack</li>
      <li>Signals are reset</li>
      <li>Registers are initialized</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The ls command is now ready to be executed in its new address space</p>
    <h3>The ls Command</h3>
    <p><code>opendir()</code> used open the current directory or directory listed</p>
    <p>Next using either the getdents() system call or readdir() with the current directory as the argument the program moves through each file in the directory</p>
    <p>As we move through each item in the directory those that match the arguments in the execv() function are called with fstat(), a variation of stat() which finds the file name and the information for each file in the current working directory for output</p>
    <p>Each item that is found is the output to STDOUT (unless redirected) with a write() system call</p>
    <p>Finally closedir(3) is used and the user can now see the files that match the arguments in the output</p>
