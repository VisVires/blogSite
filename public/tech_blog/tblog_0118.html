  <p>Yesterday, as I'm sure you can imagine was a huge fitness day, so I wasn't able to get into the tech stuff as much. Today I will be studying for an upcoming interview as well as starting my blog post for this month on the "A Well Architected Framework" AWS Whitepaper. I'd also like to start pulling my blog files from a JSON script rather than how I currently have it configured.</p>

  <p>Moved and edited my addToPhotographyJSON script to add new files and added some more pictures to my photography page.</p>

  <p>These past couple weeks have been busy ones outside of development. Today I focused on adding more to my blog post on Scrum and hopefully will be able to add a Kanban post before the end of the month. Tomorrow is a travel day so hopefully I'll be able to complete my task this evening.</p>

  <p>Focus of today and this last weekend is studying, the roles I'm interviewing for are all unique and need individual attention.</p>
