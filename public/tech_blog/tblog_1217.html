  <p>Spent today going over my old Unity Project to see if there were ways to improve it. There are certainly somethings that can be done to make it run both faster and more smooth. I'm also going to continue working on OAuth flow and would like to spend some time doing coding challenges.</p>

  <p>Not a lot of free time today, but over the weekend worked on learning oauth flow for nodejs and google app engine. I've previously done it with Python, but node is a different animal. So I'll be focusing on that as well as my next blog post for this site. I'd like to go over something I haven't before so I think it'll be java design patterns. I was asked about them in a recent interview but it's not something we reviewed at school.</p>

	  <p>Lots of clients today so having time to sit and work will be challenging. That said, after looking over the code for my PinchTest Application I've decided that instead of building the front end using Django or React it may be easier to do it with NodeJS and host it on AWS using a simple t2.nano instance for now. I'll try to learn google oauth2.0 for NodeJS today so I can work with the RESTful API hosted on Google Cloud.</p>

	  <p>Today will be a mostly interview prep day, a lot of new opportunities are rolling in so I need to focus on those. Specifically reviewing the capabilites of AWS and distributed systems computing concepts such as CAP Theorem, RAID, Relational and NoSQL Databases, and Networking. Also today I'm going to add the modal window for previous weeks updates to the site.</p>

	  <p>Today will be about refactoring some old code and start moving some old projects forward. I'd like to refactor my code for my RESTful API, my Android Project and the Unity 3D Game. I'd also like to start building the web interface for the PinchTest application so my clients have an interface they can use to monitor their results. I'll be working on these for the rest of the week. I'd also like to make a blog post about Networking Protocols. Finally I'm going to make modal windows for weekly activites to unclutter my site a bit.</p>

	  <p>Created a script to append new photos to the JSON file used for photos yesterday, so today I'm going to work on routing for the individual blog posts for both the fitness and tech blogs. Today is busy with interviews and such so we'll see how much I can get done.</p>

	  <p>The plan today is to add download links for my resume page and adjust the python script to add pictures to JSON array for photographs with options to add a caption and location for each image. Run all photos through new script with extra fields for more complete information. Considering creating batch watermarking program to watermark each photo.</p>
