  <p>Last week I made some small changes to the website to make it more mobile friendly, it still has some usability issues of which I hope to address later. As for my activity today I spent the weekend studying how to properly architect a framework and will likely make a post about the AWS Paper "A Well Architected Framework" later this week. I also did some in depth study of distributed networks and AWS tools. </p>

  <p>Today the focus will be to finish the OAuth for the Web Interface on the PinchTest Application. I'm also going to hopefully make a blog post regarding either Java design patterns or the differences in Software Development Cycles (Waterfall, Agile, Scrum) and the benefits/downfalls of each. Finally, I'm going to make the blog site mobile friendly as many of my inquiries have come from people visiting via Instagram. </p>

  <p>Today I'm going to focus on a few coding challenges via HackerRank. I'd also like to start the blog post regarding Java Design Patterns. Finally while going over my Unity Project a user mentioned allowing the user to select a routing algorithm for the Enemy AI. Currently it runs using the A-Star algoirthm. I'd like to add a randomization element to what path the enemy uses. For example one enemy could come out and use A-Star and the next could take a breathe first search or depth first search pattern. This would add a randomization to the game where users wouldn't be able to predict where the enemy may go based on previous enemies paths.</p>

  <p>Spent today going over my old Unity Project to see if there were ways to improve it. There are certainly somethings that can be done to make it run both faster and more smooth. I'm also going to continue working on OAuth flow and would like to spend some time doing coding challenges.</p>

  <p>Not a lot of free time today, but over the weekend worked on learning oauth flow for nodejs and google app engine. I've previously done it with Python, but node is a different animal. So I'll be focusing on that as well as my next blog post for this site. I'd like to go over something I haven't before so I think it'll be java design patterns. I was asked about them in a recent interview but it's not something we reviewed at school.</p>

	  <p>Lots of clients today so having time to sit and work will be challenging. That said, after looking over the code for my PinchTest Application I've decided that instead of building the front end using Django or React it may be easier to do it with NodeJS and host it on AWS using a simple t2.nano instance for now. I'll try to learn google oauth2.0 for NodeJS today so I can work with the RESTful API hosted on Google Cloud.</p>

	  <p>Today will be a mostly interview prep day, a lot of new opportunities are rolling in so I need to focus on those. Specifically reviewing the capabilites of AWS and distributed systems computing concepts such as CAP Theorem, RAID, Relational and NoSQL Databases, and Networking. Also today I'm going to add the modal window for previous weeks updates to the site.</p>

	<p class="blog-post-meta"><strong><em>November 29, 2017</em></strong></p>
	  <p>Today will be about refactoring some old code and start moving some old projects forward. I'd like to refactor my code for my RESTful API, my Android Project and the Unity 3D Game. I'd also like to start building the web interface for the PinchTest application so my clients have an interface they can use to monitor their results. I'll be working on these for the rest of the week. I'd also like to make a blog post about Networking Protocols. Finally I'm going to make modal windows for weekly activites to unclutter my site a bit.</p>

<img class="img-fluid" src="/images/tech/dev.jpg" alt="Development Comic" align="right">
  <p class="blog-post-meta">December 2017</p>
  <p>There are many factors that determine how and why you use the process that you do to develop software the goal of this post is to go over the many forms of software development and the advantages and downfalls of each form. This will be an active document through the month as I go through each form of development.</p>

  <h3>Waterfall</h3>
  <p class="blog-post-meta">December 8, 2017</p>
  <blockquote cite="https://twitter.com/energizedwork">

  </blockquote>
  <hr>
  <h4>Methodology</h4>
  <p>The waterfall development approach or the linear/traditional approach to Software Development works via a regimented sequence of events such as the following:</p>
  <ol>
  	<li>Gather and document requirements</li>
  	<li>Design</li>
  	<li>Code and Unit Testing or Implementation</li>
  	<li>System Testing</li>
  	<li>Perform User Acceptance Testing or Verification</li>
  	<li>Fix Issues</li>
  	<li>Deliver the Finished Product or Maintenance and Operations</li>
  </ol>
  <p>A true waterfall process is a process where each phase in the process is distinct and one phase must end for the other to begin.There are several advantages to using this regimented and well-defined approach in the software development process and a subset of projects that this approach would work best with. </p> 
  <h4>Advantages</h4>
  <p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>There is a clear definition and understanding of the requirements needed going forward between the customer and the development team</li>
  		<li>Progress can be easily measured as the scope of work needed to complete the project is known in advance</li>
  		<li>A project manager can plan the project so that every member can be involved and simultaneously work on other projects when they need to</li>
  		<li>A project manager can plan the project so that every member can be involved and simultaneously work on other projects when they need to and come back to this project when they are needed </li>
  		<li>Because the deliverables are well designed the software can be designed completely without adding features at the end that may waver from the original ideas. (AKA Feature Creep)</li>
  	</ul>
  </p>
  <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
  <p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>The need for specific details for requirements can be intimidating and in some cases impossible to do so before development starts. Many of these can be hashed out in the requirements/design process but in such cases you’re no longer doing a pure Waterfall approach</li>
  		<li>Customer may be dissatisfied with the product because in many cases the customer will not see the product until it is almost finished. Changes at this point can be incredibly costly as you’ll have to go back over requirements, design and implementation again.</li>
  	</ul>
  </p>
  <h4><strong>Best when used with:</strong></h4>
  <p>Smaller projects where requirements can be easily defined</p>

  <h3>Agile</h3>
  <p class="blog-post-meta">December 18, 2017</p>
  <blockquote>
  	<strong><p>"Agility is the ability to adapt and respond to change...agile organizations view change as an opportunity, not a threat" -- John Highsmith</p></strong>
  </blockquote>
  <hr>
  <h4>Methodology</h4>
  <p>Agile is an iterative approach where the emphasis is on both the customer and the team. This approach to software development emphasizes rapid delivery of applications with complete and functional components. Projects are completed in “sprints”, where certain deliverables are prioritized by the customer and each sprint has a defined duration. </p>
  <p>After each sprint the customer and team/project leads can review the work and evaluate the process. These customer reviews are essential to giving the customer the exact product they’d like.</p>
  <p>Like the waterfall approach there are some well-defined advantages and disadvatages to this approach. That being said, many of the companies I've worked with have implemented some features of Agile as their main development approach.</p>
  <h4>Advantages</h4>
  <p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>The customer is involved in the process and as such they can make changes to the product so the final product is exactly to their specs.</li>
  		<li>Using the agile approach the time to market can be a lot quicker as a bare-bones product can be released early then be built upon in successive iterations.</li>
  		<li>The customer has an opportunity to see the work being delivered and can make decisions and changes throughout the process to make sure the product delivered fits their needs</li>
  		<li>Development is normally user focused due to the involvement of the customer</li>
  		<li>The Agile development process allows for change and teams can constantly refine the product based on the customers needs.</li>
  		<li>By breaking the product down into smaller, well-defined units it can be easily tested and the final product will be higher-quality with fewer bugs. It will also be easier to integrate new features into the product.</li>
  	</ul>
  </p>
  <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
  <p>
  	<ul>
  		<li>If the customer is not an active participant due to time or interest then this process will be difficult because of the need for customer involvment at each stage of development.</li>
  		<li>This process is easiest when the team works in the same physical space due to the importance of a collabrative team environment</li>
  		<li>Some items may not be completed in the time period alloted for it. As such additional sprints may be needed to complete the project, adding to the overall cost.</li>
  		<li>While change is welcome, due to prioritizing change may come at the expense of time, money and other features.</li>
  		<li>By not having a well defined design at the start there may be feature creep, where the product doesn’t fulfill the deliverables for which it was originally conceived.</li>
  		<li>This process works best when team members are completely dedicated to the product. </li>
  	</ul>
  </p>
  <h4><strong>Best when used with:</strong></h4>
  <p>Larger projects with lots of smaller features that can be developed iteratively</p>

    <h3>Scrum</h3>
    <blockquote cite="Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time">
  	<strong><p>““No Heroics. If you need a hero to get things done, you have a problem. Heroic effort should be viewed as a failure of planning.” ― Jeff Sutherland</p></strong>
  </blockquote>
  <h4>Methodology</h4>
  <p>Scrum is an Agile framework specifically for complex projects. Like other Agile processes it emphasizes team collaboration and a set of rules to create structure. It is an iterative and incremental approach to control risk. It is a transparent, controlled process that is highly adaptable based. In scrum you have four scrum events:
 <ul>
 	<li>Sprint Planning</li>
 	<ul>
 		<li>What can be done this Sprint?</li>
 		<li>How will it get done?</li>
 		<li>How does this apply to the project?</li>
 	</ul>
 	<li>Daily Scrum</li> 
 	<ul>
 		<li>A quick meeting for the development team held every day of the sprint. During which the next 24 hours of the sprint are planned. The goal is to optimize team collaboration and performance while eliminating other impediments like extra meetings and promoting quick decision making.</li>
 	</ul>
 	<li>Sprint Review</li>
 	<ul>
 		<li>A meeting at thend of the sprint to go over what was accomplished, increment the product backlog and a collaboration on the next steps needed to optimize value.</li>
 	</ul>
 	<li>Sprint Retrospective</li>
 	<ul>
 		<li>A meeting to look at a sprint and create a plan to improve for the next one. Specifically looking at people, relationships, process and tools and improving the way the Scrum team functions.</li>
 	</ul>
 </ul>
 The scrum team consists of three members/groups and incrementally delivers finished products so that a potentially working product is always available. The members of the team consist of the:
 <ul>
 	<li>Product Owner</li>
 		<ul>
 			<li>One person who manages the product backlog and ensures that it is transparent, and visible to all. Also this person will optimize the work of the Development team and show what the team will work on next.</li>
 		</ul>
 	<li>The Development Team</li>
 	<ul>
 		<li>A team small enough to remain nimble but large enough to perform the work needed in the pre-defined sprint period. Accountability for the team is taken on by the team as a while and all domains including testing, operations, and architecture is managed by the team. These are the members who deliver the finished increment at the end of each sprint</li>
 	</ul>
 	<li>The Scrum Master</li>
 	<ul>
 		<li>The role of the Scrum master is be a servant to the team and making sure the team understands the rules, theory and practices of Scrum. Basically the Scrum master acts as the ambassador to Scrum development and keeps the team informed of any deviations from Scrum.</li>
 	</ul>
 </ul></p>
  <h4>Advantages</h4>
  <p><ul>
  	<li>Fast moving and flexible</li>
  	<li>Mistakes can be easily rectified due to smaller goals</li>
  	<li>Extremely transparent process with constant feedback</li>
  	<li>Iterative in nature and requires constant user feedback</li>
  	<li>Overhead cost due to managment is minimal as there are predefined time and fixed oversight</li>
  	<li></li>
  </ul></p>
  <h4>Disadvantages</h4>
  <p><ul>
  	<li>Potential for feature and scope creep</li>
  	<li>Hard to estimate overall project costs if product is not well-defined</li>
  	<li>Only works well with a small, experienced team. With inexperienced novices the projects will not be completed</li>
  	<li>Team members must be devoted to the project and cannot leave during development</li>
  </ul></p>
  <h4><strong>Best when used with:</strong></h4>
