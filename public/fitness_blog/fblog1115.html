<h2 class="blog-post-title">What I'm Working On Now...</h2>
<p class="blog-post-meta">November 2017</p>
<p>For me the month of November is all about preparation. For many of us it's the start of the time to be merry with friends and family and take in all the holiday season has to give. For some of us we tend to take in a bit too much and notice it around our waist line as the new year rolls around. So this year I'm taking steps to prepare myself and my clients for the coming months so we can not only have fun this season, but make decisions that will help us stay on our path. For me personally I'm focusing on getting more athletic and prepping myself for the slopes (which opened last week!!). I'll posting a few of my workouts here to give you an idea of the kind of work I'm doing.</p>

<h2 class="blog-post-title">The Importance of Client Health for Long-Term Success</h2>
<p class="blog-post-meta">November 22, 2017</p>
<p>As a personal trainer itâ€™s your responsibility to get your client to their goals quickly and to keep the client happy. One aspect of the job that is often overlooked is the need to keep a client healthy. Many trainers will either push clients too hard in the name of giving them a grueling workout or will have them do exercises that are either unsafe or beyond the clients ability for the sake of making the workout more fun. Not prioritizing client safety though can be a unrecoverable risk for both you and your client.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>I've been working in the fitness industry for over 10 years and have trained at both public and private facilities among many trainers from different backgrounds, with different styles. Many trainers, especially those who are just starting out have a sole focus when training clients; to give them great workout every time. Other things that are important to the client in order to reach their goals are often not prioritized such as periodization, proper nutrition, and safety. I'll admit that when I was just starting out I was one of those trainers that would put together workouts with no thought other than these exercises are hard to do.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>How to Avoid these Trainers</h3>
<p> Trainers like these are more often than not seen in public gyms but I&rsquo;ve come across a few at the 3 private facilities I&rsquo;ve worked at as well. They are the types you see using fitness buzzwords such as &ldquo;functional training&rdquo; to describe their training style (when did bouncing on bosu ball doing push ups become functional?), with large groups of clients of different age ranges and physical abilities doing the same workouts.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> Many trainers who design these workouts don't understand or don't care that a fit lifestyle is a marathon and not a sprint. Sure having fun workouts from week to week can be great and may keep your client coming back but the fastest way to derail someone from their goal is for them to get hurt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So how do you avoid trainers like this? It&rsquo;s a lot harder than it would seem especially to those not familiar to the industry but there a couple distinct warning signs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Signs of a Bad Trainer</h3>
<p>The first and most important of which being the lack of an assessment period. Your first few sessions with a trainer should be a time when you&rsquo;re both feeling each other out, for the trainer this time should be spent assessing your current abilities, checking your flexibility, and figuring out where you weaknesses are then giving you the tools you need to fix them. If the trainer immediately throws you into the fire then run away and don&rsquo;t come back. It&rsquo;s clear this trainer places no importance on proper progression and in the best case you&rsquo;ll end up only slightly closer to your original goal and in the worst you&rsquo;ll end up hurt.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second sign is slightly related to the first. If you come and it seems like your trainer does not have a plan for what you&rsquo;re going to do then there&rsquo;s a good chance that is how all of his/her workouts will be done. Recently I witnessed a trainer do this, constantly asking the client what he'd like to do next rather than actually having a workout for them. As a trainer you're being paid to be the guide, what value do you bring to client if the client has to come up with their own workout?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, occasionally things come up and clients can&rsquo;t do the workout the trainer planned for them. Perhaps the client just got back from a long business trip and they need more mobility work, or an important piece of equipment in the gym is no longer available. In such cases it is important for the trainer to be able to adapt and change the plan. But if it seems as if every workout is thrown together at the last minute then they probably were.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finally if your trainer does not take notes throughout the session you may want to second guess working with them. Whether it be the old fashioned way with a notebook and paper or like I do on an iPad, keeping notes from previous workouts is imperative to client success. A trainer needs to be able to track weights, imbalances and potential risks for each exercise with each client. These can be a great selling tool because the trainer can show a client his/her progress from workout to workout.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>What Steps Can You Take to Keep Yourself Healthy?</h3>
<p>As a new client you should avoid group workouts at first and try to work with your trainer one-on-one so that he/she can bring you up to speed to the rest of the class. Also be mindful of your own abilities, your trainer will push you (that&rsquo;s their job) but don&rsquo;t go too far out of your comfort zone. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to speak up if a trainer is asking you to do something that you feel may compromise your ability to perform in the long run and understand the difference between a good hurt (sore muscles and fatigue) and a bad hurt (strained muscles and sore joints). Take adequate rest between workouts where you&rsquo;re training the same muscle groups and allow your body time to recover.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>As a Trainer, Why Should I Care?</h3>
<p>There are several reasons client health should be one of the most important things to you as a trainer. First and foremost, an injured client is likely not a client who is training often. And by putting your client at risk you are putting your own income at risk because a client who is not training is a client who is not paying for your services. Now there are some injuries a client can work through or in some cases you can act as a physical therapy assistant, helping the client with the exercises provided by the specialist to move the healing process along. That said, where&rsquo;s the fun in that? Also how is that getting your client closer to his/her goal? Set backs are not fun for anyone and will cost you both time and money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why as a trainer it is in your best interest to keep your client healthy. Slow and steady progress is sustainable progress. Focus on making small, specific goals and working towards those. Eventually your client will be successful. Motivation is much easier when you can show your clients where they&rsquo;ve come from and give them realistic ideas of where you can take them. Don&rsquo;t add workouts you can barely do with good form just to make the workouts more fun. Be smart, emphasize progression, focus on form and function, and understand the best client is the one that can keep coming back.</p>
